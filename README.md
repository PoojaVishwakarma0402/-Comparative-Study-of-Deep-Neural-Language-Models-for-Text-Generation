# -Comparative-Study-of-Deep-Neural-Language-Models-for-Text-Generation

Overview
This repository contains the research, code, and resources for the study titled "Comparative Study of Deep Neural Language Models for Text Generation". The study aims to explore various state-of-the-art deep neural language models, analyzing their architecture, training methodologies, and performance in generating human-like text. Our work provides a comparative analysis that can guide future research and practical applications in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).


Objectives
The primary objectives of this study are:

Investigate different deep neural language models used for text generation.
Compare the models based on text generation quality, coherence, computational efficiency, and other relevant metrics.
Identify the strengths and limitations of each model to provide insights for future research and practical applications.
Models Studied
In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the following deep neural language models:

GPT-2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 2):

Developed by OpenAI.
Utilizes the Transformer architecture.
Known for its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):

Developed by Google.
Focuses on understanding the context of words in search queries.
Emphasizes bidirectional training, capturing context from both directions.
XLNet:

Developed by Google AI Brain and Carnegie Mellon University.
Combines the best of both autoregressive and autoencoding models.
Improves upon BERT by predicting words using permutations of sequences.
T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer):

Developed by Google.
Converts all NLP tasks into a text-to-text format.
Versatile and effective across various NLP tasks, including text generation.
Methodology
Our study was conducted using a structured methodology to ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison:

Data Collection:

We collected diverse datasets suitable for training and evaluating text generation models.
Datasets included large corpora of text from various domains to assess the models' ability to generalize across contexts.
Model Training:

Each model was trained on the same datasets to maintain consistency.
Hyperparameters were carefully tuned for optimal performance.
Evaluation Metrics:

We evaluated the models using several metrics, including:
BLEU Score: Measures the quality of the generated text compared to reference sentences.
Perplexity: Indicates how well the model predicts the next word in a sequence.
Human Judgment: Subjective evaluation of text quality and coherence by human reviewers.
Computational efficiency was also assessed by measuring the time and resources required for training and inference.
Results
Our study reveals distinct differences in the performance of the models:

GPT-2 excelled in generating coherent and contextually relevant text, making it ideal for creative writing tasks.
BERT demonstrated strong performance in understanding context but was less effective in generating long coherent text.
XLNet improved over BERT by capturing bidirectional context more effectively and generating more accurate predictions.
T5 was the most versatile, performing well across different NLP tasks, including text generation, but required more computational resources.
Detailed results and comparison charts can be found in the results/ section of this repository.

Conclusion
The study concludes with the following recommendations:

GPT-2 is recommended for tasks requiring high-quality text generation with contextual relevance.
BERT and XLNet are better suited for tasks focused on text comprehension and context analysis.
T5 is the model of choice for tasks that require flexibility and versatility across different NLP tasks.
The study also identifies potential areas for future research, such as enhancing the coherence and context-awareness of generated text and improving computational efficiency.
